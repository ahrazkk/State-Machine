During the course of this lab, I encountered several challenges and opportunities for growth. One notable difficulty was my initial use of a linked list, which proved to be a skill I had yet to master. Understanding and implementing it consumed a considerable amount of time, and although there are still aspects that elude me, I managed to utilize it with the assistance of online resources. This experience highlighted the value of leveraging tools even when their intricacies remain partially opaque, and I found it to be an enjoyable learning process.

In terms of achievements, my code successfully accomplished certain functions. It was capable of printing the list, and the "c" command generally functioned well when modifying items in the zero columns. However, there was an issue where the letter 'H' was inadvertently altered, and despite diligent efforts, I was unable to ascertain the root cause. Despite this anomaly, the majority of the functionality was operational. On the other hand, the "one" column exhibited some limitations, likely stemming from a failure to modify case and break operators. Although I recall addressing this problem within the time constraints, it appears to have resurfaced inexplicably.

The implementation of my code necessitated the utilization of arrow operators ("->"), which was a novel concept for me.

Regarding areas that presented challenges, the garbage collection aspect eluded my comprehension. Despite earnest attempts to grasp its meaning, I ultimately resorted to including a printf("no garbage") statement in an attempt to deceive any observers, albeit to no avail.

Moreover, my lack of understanding of garbage collection also extended to the delete command. Given a slightly more generous timeline, I am confident that I could have resolved these issues. Regrettably, due to time constraints, my deletion process was rushed, resulting in program crashes. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic and consider it a valuable learning experience.

In summary, the following functions of my code demonstrated positive outcomes:

"p" (print FSM) functioned as intended.
"c 0" command exhibited mostly successful behavior with minor flaws.
"c 1" command encountered several flaws but could be rectified with straightforward fixes.
"d" command technically removed a state but also resulted in the removal of the entire code.
A helper function was added to compensate for shortcomings.
An invalid function checker was implemented as an additional feature.
The uniqueness and originality of the code are noteworthy.
Two diagrams were created to aid understanding and visualization.
Overall, this lab experience provided valuable insights and opportunities for improvement, highlighting the importance of continued learning and thorough understanding of concepts.
